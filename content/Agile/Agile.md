## Definition

> "Agile methods replace high-level design with frequent redesign"

The problem started with experience developers being unable to write software that was unable to attract software, but was alright in terms of engineering. They were building things no one wanted.

You are successful if the customer says you are good.

Relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development, that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment and adaptation of plans.

The main problems are,

1. **The Division Of Tasks Into Short Phases Of Work**: You need to divide th work into smaller tasks
2. **Frequent Assessment**: Software that will be made will have some users, and the needs of the user will change over time. The discussions should ideally be daily between the developers. The time with the users can be delayed to a week maybe

## Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde

Wrong tools and improper planning result in wasted time.

But given the scale, it matters how you plan things out.

1. If things are smaller and simpler, a brute force approach works
2. If things are bigger and on a larger scale, planning works better

## Getting To Agile

Observation -> Ideas {1} -> Designs {2} -> Code Or Execution {3} -> Tests {4} -> Deployment {5} -> Released Product {6}

Where,

1. Continuous Design: {1}, {2} - Features w/ High Engagement Total Features Released
2. Agile Development: {3} - Total Features Released
3. Deployment: {4}, {5} - Frequency of releases

## Agile Origins

### Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work, we have come to value,

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### Focal Points

1. Focus on the individual with testable narratives
   1. Discuss with customers
2. Front load value
   1. We need value
   2. So how would be get the value?
   3. We need to find out the items that have value
   4. Give the customer up front the item that seem to be valuable to them as soon as possible
3. Outcomes vs. Output
   1. **Outcomes**: Perceived value of the software, un-intelligible
   2. **Output**: The actual seen value of the software, intelligible
