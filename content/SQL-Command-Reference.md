## Getting Started

For this, I simply made a Docker container for MySQL (<https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql>) and used two tables only for the examples.

The SQL of the two tables is shared.

Then DataGrip was used to connect to the DB so the SQL queries could be run in a flexible editor.

Of course, whatever works for you. Anything is fine, really.
