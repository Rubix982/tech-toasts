## Data Analytics, Business Benefits, Smart Services

- Almost any object can be connected, multiple types of sensors can be installed on a given object
- A smarter architectural choice may be to allow for an open system where the network is engineered to be flexible enough that other sensors may be added in the future
- Enhanced data processing can result in new added value for businesses that are not envisioned at the time when the system is initially developed
- This type of alert is a time saver, and avoids the need for the repair team to our all the machines in turn when only one may be malfunctioning

## Smart Services

- Smart Services use IoT, and aim for efficiency
- For example, sensors can be installed on equipment to ensure ongoing conformance with regulation or safety requirements
- Smart Services can also be used to measure the efficiency of machine by detecting machine output, speed, or other forms of usage evaluation
- Presence and motion sensors can evaluate the number of guests in a lobby and redirect personnel accordingly

## IoT Data Management & Compute Stack

In most cases, the processing location is outside the smart object. Smart objects need to connect to the cloud, and data processing is centralized. One advantage of this model is simplicity.

This model has limitations. These requirements tend to bring the need for data analysis closer to the IoT system.
