## Contiki

OS for simulating devices, and IoT.

Third party not allowed.

## SDN

Traditional Networking is ended - you no longer depend on the vendor. Different vendor products can talk to each other.

Needs interface for communication.

Third party allowed.

Separates the Data Plane and Control Plane.

### Controller

After introducing controller, the dependency has ended, and all talk to the SDN.

What modules does it have? What topology does it have?

For example, how the data can be transferred.

There is a file called SDN-WISE Java.
