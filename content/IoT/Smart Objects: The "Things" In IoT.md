## Components

Much like sensors, actuators also vary greatly in function, size, design, and so on. Some common ways that they can be classified include the following,

1. **Types Of Motion**: Actuators classified base on the type of motion
2. **Power**: Actuators classified based on their power output
3. **Binary/Continuous**: Based on number of stable-state outputs
4. **Area Of Application**: Based on specific industry/vertical where they are used
5. **Type Of Energy**: Based on their energy type

## Smart Objects

A device that has, at a minimum, the following four defining characteristics,

1. Processing Unit
2. Sensor(s) And/Or Actuator(s)
3. Communication Device

### Trends

They vary wildly in function, technical requirements, form factor, deployment conditions, and so on.

Trends impacting IoT,

1. **Size Is Decreasing**: Some smart objects are so small, they are not even visible to the naked eye. This reduced size makes smart objects easier to embed in everyday objects
2. **Power Consumption Is Decreasing**: Some battery-powered sensors last 10 years or more without battery replacement
3. **Processing Power Is Increasing**: Becoming increasingly complex/connected
4. **Communication Capabilities Are Improving**: Development of more and more specialized communication protocols covering a greater diversity of use cases and environments
5. **Communication Is Being Increasingly Standardized**: There are more and more open source effort to advance IoT
