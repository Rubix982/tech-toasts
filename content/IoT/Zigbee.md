## Zigbee

In the application layer, we have customized TCP and UDP layers, and it is up for us to decide on how th message is transferred.

## IP

We discussed some use cases, about TCP and UDP, what applications, where we require the Zigbee, and we require traditional protocols like TCP and UDP.

## Physical Layer

On perspective of security. If we have these headers, and anything from the transport layer enters our layers. How will we provide security for that.

## Topology

### Body Area Network (BAN)

What role do topologies play here?

Dynamic, flexible, topology matters.
