## Flooding By Attackers

This kind of overload threat can be easily detected by Matchboard Profiler. If the attacker characteristic is found, the user can be filtered at the firewall.

## Flooding By Legitimates (flash crowd)

This can be solved by buffering an excess number o requests so that ths overload condition remains live only for a certain period of time.

## Flooding By Spoofing Attackers

This is caused by impersonation which can be detected by acknowledging each request and by maintaining the sequence number of the requests and requesters' Internet Protocol (IP) address.

## Attacks As Per Architecture

### External Attack

Trustworthiness of the cloud service provider is the key concern. Organizations deliberately offload both sensitive and insensitive data to obtain

### Wormhole Attack

Wormhole attack is very popular in ad hoc networks. The intruder just captures the data, forwards them to another node, and retransmits them from that node. Wormhole attacks very strange and difficult to identify.

### Selective Forwarding Attack

### Sinkhole Attack

Sensors, which are left unattended in the network 

### Sewage Pool Attack

In a sewage pool attack, the malicious user's objective is to attract all the messages of a selected region toward it and then interchange the base station node in order to make selective attacks less effective.
