## Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL)

1. We use the Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) to query organization's Salesforce data for specific information
2. SOQL is similar to the SELECT statement in SQL but is designed specifically for Salesforce data
3. Similar to the SELECT command in Structured Query Language (SQL), SOQL allows you to specify the **source object**(such as Account), a **list of fields** to retrieve, and conditions for selecting rows in the source object
4. SOQL doesn't support all advanced features of the SQL SELECT command. For example, you can't use SOQL to **perform arbitrary join operations**, **use wildcards in field lists**, or use **calculation expressions**

## Condition Expression (WHERE Clause) in SOQL

1. You can specify multiple field expressions to a condition expression by using logical operators (**AND**, **OR**, **NOT**)
